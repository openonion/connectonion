# Documentation Principles & Tutorial Writing Guide

## Core Philosophy: Simple ‚Üí Possible ‚Üí Powerful

ConnectOnion follows the principle: **"Keep simple things simple, make complicated things possible"**

This guides how we structure documentation, order tutorials, and present concepts.

## üìö Documentation Ordering Principles

### 1. The Learning Journey (Current Sidebar Order)

```
1. Getting Started
   - Introduction (Why)
   - Quick Start (How to begin)
   - CLI Reference (Tools)

2. Core Concepts (The Foundation)
   - System Prompts (Define behavior - WHAT)
   - Tools (Add capabilities - HOW)  
   - max_iterations (Control execution - SAFETY)
   - LLM Function (Direct usage - FLEXIBILITY)
   - Trust Parameter (Multi-agent - SCALING)
   - @xray Decorator (Debugging - TROUBLESHOOTING)

3. Advanced Features
   - trace() Visual Flow
   - Prompt Formats

4. Security
   - Threat Model

5. Examples (Theory ‚Üí Practice)
   - Hello World (Simplest)
   - Calculator (Basic tools)
   - Weather Bot (External APIs)
   - Advanced Examples

6. Blog (Deep Dives)
   - Design decisions
   - Architecture insights
```

### 2. The "2-5-10" Rule

Each concept should be learnable in:
- **2 lines**: Minimal working example
- **5 lines**: Practical usage
- **10 lines**: Production-ready

Example:
```python
# 2 lines - It works!
agent = Agent("helper", tools=[greet])
agent.run("Say hello")

# 5 lines - It's useful!
agent = Agent("helper", 
              tools=[greet, calculate],
              system_prompt="Be helpful")
result = agent.run("Greet John and calculate 2+2")
print(result)

# 10 lines - It's production-ready!
agent = Agent("helper",
              tools=[greet, calculate, search],
              system_prompt=load_prompt("assistant.md"),
              max_iterations=5,
              trust="prompt")
              
with xray.trace():
    result = agent.run(user_input)
    save_to_history(result)
```

## üéØ Tutorial Progression Pattern

### Level 1: Recognition (They can identify it)
**Goal**: User recognizes the concept exists
- Show the simplest possible example
- One concept at a time
- Copy-paste ready

### Level 2: Understanding (They know why)
**Goal**: User understands when to use it
- Explain the problem it solves
- Compare with alternatives
- Show common patterns

### Level 3: Application (They can use it)
**Goal**: User can apply it to their needs
- Multiple examples
- Edge cases
- Integration with other features

### Level 4: Mastery (They can teach it)
**Goal**: User can adapt and extend
- Advanced patterns
- Performance considerations
- Best practices

## üìù Writing Principles

### 1. Start with Success
```markdown
BAD:  "Before you can use agents, you need to understand..."
GOOD: "Here's your first agent in 2 lines:"
```

### 2. Show, Then Explain
```markdown
BAD:  "Agents use tools which are functions that..."
GOOD: [Show working code] ‚Üí "This works because..."
```

### 3. Progressive Disclosure
```python
# First introduction
agent = Agent("assistant")

# Later, add complexity
agent = Agent("assistant", tools=[...])

# Even later
agent = Agent("assistant", 
              tools=[...],
              system_prompt="...",
              max_iterations=10)
```

### 4. Real Problems, Real Solutions
```markdown
BAD:  "You can use foo() to process data"
GOOD: "When users ask for calculations, here's how to handle it:"
```

## üîÑ The Learning Loop

```
1. Minimal Example (Works immediately)
   ‚Üì
2. Practical Example (Solves real problem)
   ‚Üì
3. Production Example (Ready to deploy)
   ‚Üì
4. Deep Dive (Understanding internals)
```

## üìä Complexity Ladder

Each page should follow this structure:

```markdown
## Quick Start (30 seconds)
[Minimal working example]

## Basic Usage (2 minutes)
[Common patterns]

## Advanced Usage (5 minutes)
[Production patterns]

## Reference (As needed)
[Complete API details]
```

## üé® Visual Hierarchy

1. **Hero Example**: The one example that shows the essence
2. **Comparison Table**: When to use what
3. **Decision Tree**: If X then Y
4. **Progressive Examples**: Building complexity
5. **Gotchas Box**: Common mistakes

## ‚úÖ Documentation Checklist

For each documentation page:

- [ ] Starts with working code (< 5 lines)
- [ ] Includes "When to use this"
- [ ] Has progressive examples (simple ‚Üí complex)
- [ ] Shows common mistakes
- [ ] Links to related concepts
- [ ] Includes performance notes (if relevant)
- [ ] Has debug/troubleshooting section

## üöÄ The "ConnectOnion Way"

### Good Documentation:
```python
# ‚úÖ Start simple
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello {name}!"

agent = Agent("assistant", tools=[greet])

# ‚úÖ Show progression
# Add more tools as needed...
agent = Agent("assistant", tools=[greet, calculate, search])

# ‚úÖ Show production usage
agent = Agent("assistant",
              tools=load_tools(),
              system_prompt=load_prompt("assistant.md"),
              max_iterations=10)
```

### Poor Documentation:
```python
# ‚ùå Start complex
class AbstractAgentFactory(BaseAgent):
    def __init__(self, config: AgentConfig, 
                 registry: ToolRegistry,
                 executor: ExecutionEngine):
        # ... 50 lines of setup
```

## üéØ Success Metrics

Good documentation achieves:
1. **Time to First Success**: < 60 seconds
2. **Concept to Code**: < 5 minutes
3. **Understanding to Production**: < 30 minutes

## Remember

> "If it takes more than 2 lines to start, we've failed at simplicity"
> "If it takes more than 10 lines for production, we've failed at practicality"
> "Documentation is UX for developers"
