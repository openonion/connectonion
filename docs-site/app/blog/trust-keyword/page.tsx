*December 2024*

When designing ConnectOnion's agent-to-agent authentication system, we faced a crucial decision: what should we call the parameter that controls how agents verify each other? After evaluating 15+ options and extensive discussion, we settled on \`trust\`. Here's why.

## The Challenge: Finding a Bidirectional Word

Our authentication system needed a keyword that works in two directions:
1. **As a service provider**: "Who can use my services?"
2. **As a service consumer**: "Which services do I trust?"

Most security terms only work in one direction. We needed something that naturally flows both ways.

## Options We Considered

### 1. \`auth\` / \`authentication\`
**Why not**: Too technical and implies traditional authentication (passwords, tokens). We're doing behavioral verification, not credential checking.

### 2. \`verify\` / \`validate\`
**Why not**: One-directional - you verify others, but saying "I'm verified" sounds like a credential system.

### 3. \`guard\` / \`guardian\`
**Why not**: Implies blocking/protection only. Doesn't capture the mutual relationship between agents.

### 4. \`policy\` / \`rules\`
**Why not**: Too formal and configuration-heavy. Doesn't match our natural language approach.

### 5. \`security\` / \`safe\`
**Why not**: Too broad and creates fear. Security implies threats; we want collaboration.

### 6. \`filter\` / \`allow\`
**Why not**: One-directional and negative. Focuses on exclusion rather than building relationships.

### 7. \`mode\` / \`env\`
**Why not**: Too generic. Could mean anything - doesn't clearly indicate authentication purpose.

### 8. \`strict\` / \`open\` / \`tested\`
**Why not**: These became our trust *levels*, but the parameter itself needed a clearer name.

### 9. \`require\` / \`expect\`
**Why not**: Works for incoming but awkward for outgoing ("I require others" vs "I'm required"?).

### 10. \`proof\` / \`evidence\`
**Why not**: Sounds like blockchain/cryptographic proof. We're not doing that.

### 11. \`access\` / \`permission\`
**Why not**: Traditional access control terminology. Doesn't reflect our behavioral approach.

### 12. \`handshake\` / \`protocol\`
**Why not**: Too network/technical. Users shouldn't need to think about protocols.

### 13. \`partner\` / \`peer\`
**Why not**: Implies equality. Sometimes agents have asymmetric relationships.

### 14. \`contract\` / \`agreement\`
**Why not**: Too formal/legal. Creates barrier to entry.

### 15. \`friend\` / \`buddy\`
**Why not**: Too casual. Doesn't convey the seriousness of authentication.

## Why "Trust" Won

\`trust\` succeeded where others failed because:

### 1. **Naturally Bidirectional**
- "I trust you" (outgoing)
- "You trust me" (incoming)
- "We trust each other" (mutual)

The word flows naturally in all directions without awkward phrasing.

### 2. **Human-Friendly**
Everyone understands trust. It's not technical jargon. Your grandmother knows what trust means.

### 3. **Progressive, Not Binary**
Trust has levels:
- \`trust="open"\` - Trust everyone (development)
- \`trust="tested"\` - Trust verified agents (staging)
- \`trust="strict"\` - Trust allowlisted agents (production)

This mirrors how human trust works - it's earned and has degrees.

### 4. **Matches Our Philosophy**
We're not doing cryptographic verification. We're doing behavioral verification. Trust is earned through successful interactions, not certificates.

### 5. **Clear Configuration**
\`\`\`python
# Instantly understandable
agent = Agent(name="helper", trust="open")

# Compare to alternatives:
agent = Agent(name="helper", auth="permissive")  # What's permissive auth?
agent = Agent(name="helper", verify="none")      # Verify none? Confusing.
agent = Agent(name="helper", mode="dev")         # Mode of what?
\`\`\`

## The Unix Philosophy Connection

Just as Unix uses simple, composable commands, we use simple trust levels that combine with prompts for complex behavior:

\`\`\`python
# Simple trust + smart prompt = sophisticated behavior
agent = Agent(
    name="analyzer",
    trust="tested",
    system_prompt="Only accept tasks from agents that have successfully completed 10+ analyses"
)
\`\`\`

The prompt handles the sophisticated logic. The trust parameter stays simple.

## Trust in Action

### Service Provider Perspective
\`\`\`python
@agent.on_request
def handle_request(task, sender):
    # trust="strict" already filtered untrusted senders
    # We only see requests from trusted agents
    return process_task(task)
\`\`\`

### Service Consumer Perspective
\`\`\`python
# Only connect to trusted services
providers = agent.find_services(trust="tested")
\`\`\`

### Mutual Trust Building
\`\`\`python
# Start cautious
agent = Agent(name="researcher", trust="tested")

# After successful interactions, upgrade
if interaction_count > 100 and success_rate > 0.95:
    agent.add_trusted_contact(other_agent)
\`\`\`

## What This Enables

1. **Gradual Rollouts**: Start with \`trust="strict"\`, gradually open up
2. **Development Freedom**: Use \`trust="open"\` for rapid prototyping
3. **Natural Language Policies**: Combine with prompts for sophisticated rules
4. **Behavioral Security**: Trust through proven track record, not credentials

## The Bigger Picture

Choosing "trust" reflects ConnectOnion's philosophy:
- **Human-first design**: Use words people understand
- **Progressive enhancement**: Start simple, add complexity through composition
- **Behavioral over cryptographic**: Actions matter more than certificates
- **Natural language configuration**: Settings should read like sentences

## Looking Back

After months of usage, "trust" has proven perfect:
- Zero confusion about what it does
- Natural to explain to new users
- Flexible enough for all use cases
- Memorable and meaningful

Sometimes the best technical decisions are the least technical ones.`
