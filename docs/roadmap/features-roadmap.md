# ConnectOnion Features Roadmap

*Features designed for agent developers who want their agents to collaborate*

## Phase 1: Core Features (MVP)

### 1. Make Your Agent Discoverable
```python
from connectonion import agent

@agent
def translate(text: str, to_lang: str) -> str:
    """I translate text to any language"""
    return my_translation_logic(text, to_lang)

# That's it! Your agent is now discoverable by other agents
```

### 2. Discover Other Agents
```python
from connectonion import discover

# Inside your agent
def process_foreign_text(text: str):
    translator = discover("translate text")
    english = translator(text, to_lang="en")
    return process(english)
```

### 3. Test Before Trust
```python
def get_reliable_translator():
    translators = discover.all("translate")
    
    for t in translators:
        result = t.test("Hello", to_lang="es")
        if result == "Hola":
            return t  # This one works!
```

### 4. Start Serving
```bash
# One command to make your agents available
$ connectonion serve my_agent.py
# Serving translate() on local network
# Other agents can now discover you!
```

## Phase 2: Essential Features

### 5. Semantic Discovery
```python
# Find by meaning, not keywords
summarizer = discover("make text shorter")
analyzer = discover("understand customer feelings")
calculator = discover("solve math problems")
```

### 6. Compose Agents
```python
@agent
def research_assistant(topic: str) -> str:
    """I research topics thoroughly"""
    
    # Chain agents together
    search = discover("web search")
    summarize = discover("summarize")
    verify = discover("fact check")
    
    results = search(topic)
    summary = summarize(results)
    verified = verify(summary)
    
    return verified
```

### 7. Track Your Experience
```python
translator = discover("translate")

# After using it
print(translator.my_experience)
# Output: Used 45 times, 98% success, avg 43ms

# Auto-prefer reliable agents
best_translator = discover("translate", prefer_reliable=True)
```

### 8. Handle Failures Gracefully
```python
from connectonion import fallback

@agent
def reliable_service(data):
    # Try primary, fallback to secondary
    result = fallback(
        lambda: discover("premium analyzer")(data),
        lambda: discover("basic analyzer")(data),
        lambda: "Analysis temporarily unavailable"
    )
    return result
```

## Phase 3: Power Features

### 9. See Your Agent's Impact
```python
from connectonion import my_agent

my_agent.dashboard()
"""
Agent: translator
Status: Active ✓
Health: 99.2%

Today:
- Calls: 1,234
- Unique users: 67
- Avg response: 45ms
- Errors: 3
- Earnings: $12.34

Top users:
- research_assistant (234 calls)
- news_analyzer (187 calls)
- chatbot (134 calls)
"""
```

### 10. Agent REPL
```bash
$ connectonion repl

>>> discover translate
Found 3 agents:
1. babel_fish (45ms avg, 99% success)
2. polyglot (89ms avg, 95% success)
3. translator_pro (123ms avg, 97% success)

>>> test babel_fish "Hello world" spanish
"Hola mundo" (42ms)

>>> use babel_fish
Selected babel_fish as default translator

>>> stats
Your agents: 2 active
- calculator: 534 calls today
- formatter: 89 calls today
Network: 1,337 agents available
```

### 11. Monitor Health
```python
@agent
def smart_agent(data):
    with monitor() as m:
        processor = discover("process data")
        result = processor(data)
    
    if m.response_time > 1000:  # Slow!
        self.find_alternative(processor)
    
    return result
```

### 12. Cost Controls
```python
# Set spending limits
expensive_ai = discover("gpt-4 analyzer", max_cost=0.10)

# Track costs
translator = discover("translate")
result = translator("Hello", cost_aware=True)
print(result.cost)  # $0.002

# Monthly limits
discover.set_monthly_budget(10.00)  # $10/month max
```

## Phase 4: Advanced Features

### 13. Visual Network Explorer
```python
from connectonion import visualize

# See the living network
visualize.network()
# Opens browser showing:
# - Active agents (nodes)
# - Current calls (animated edges)
# - Your agents highlighted
# - Performance metrics overlaid
```

### 14. Time Travel Debugging
```python
from connectonion import replay

# Something went wrong?
replay.last_error()
"""
Timeline:
10:32:01.234 > Your request: analyze(data)
10:32:01.245 > Discovered: analyzer_v2
10:32:01.267 > Test passed
10:32:01.289 > Execution started
10:32:03.445 > ERROR: Timeout
10:32:03.446 > Fallback: analyzer_v1
10:32:03.890 > Success
"""

# Replay any step
replay.step(3).debug()
```

### 15. Pipeline Builder
```python
# Visual pipeline construction
from connectonion import pipeline

# Define reusable pipelines
translate_and_analyze = pipeline(
    discover("detect language"),
    discover("translate to english"),
    discover("sentiment analysis"),
    discover("extract key points")
)

result = translate_and_analyze(foreign_text)
```

### 16. Agent Versioning
```python
# Pin specific versions
translator = discover("translate", version="stable")

# Or use latest
translator = discover("translate", version="latest")

# See version history
discover.history("translate")
"""
v3.2 (current): Added Arabic support
v3.1: Performance improvements 
v3.0: Major refactor
"""
```

## Phase 5: Ecosystem Features

### 17. Agent Marketplace
```python
# Publish your agent
$ connectonion publish ./my_agent.py
# Publishing sentiment_analyzer...
# Set price (optional): $0.001/call
# Published! Install with: pip install agents/sentiment_analyzer

# Browse available agents
$ connectonion browse
# Featured agents:
# - gpt4_wrapper: Direct GPT-4 access ($0.01/call)
# - image_analyzer: Computer vision (free)
# - sql_generator: Text to SQL ($0.001/call)
```

### 18. Enterprise Features
```python
# Private network for company
$ connectonion serve --network company.local

# Access controls
@agent(auth="company_only")
def proprietary_analyzer(data):
    return analyze_with_secret_sauce(data)

# Audit logs
discover.audit_log()
"""
2024-01-10 10:23:01 marketing_agent called analyzer
2024-01-10 10:24:15 sales_agent called translator
"""
```

## Developer Experience Goals

**Onboarding**: 
- Install → First agent working: < 2 minutes
- First agent composition: < 5 minutes
- Understanding core concepts: < 10 minutes

**Daily Use**:
- Most common operations: 1 line of code
- Debugging problems: Clear, visual tools
- Performance monitoring: Always available

**Growth**:
- Simple agents → Complex orchestrations
- Local testing → Global network
- Free usage → Revenue generation

## Success Metrics

- **Adoption**: 10,000 developers in 6 months
- **Network Growth**: 1,000 unique agents in 3 months
- **Usage**: 1M agent-to-agent calls per day by month 6
- **Developer Joy**: "I can't imagine building agents without this"

## Principles We Follow

1. **One-line simplicity** - Common tasks = 1 line of code
2. **Progressive disclosure** - Simple first, power when needed
3. **Fail gracefully** - Never crash, always have fallbacks
4. **Local first** - Works without internet
5. **Trust through experience** - Not certificates

## What We DON'T Build

❌ Complex authentication systems
❌ Global reputation scores
❌ Central registries
❌ API key management
❌ Permission hierarchies
❌ Blockchain anything

## The Promise

**"Make your agent discoverable in 1 line. Discover others in 1 line. Compose them like functions."**

That's the entire learning curve.
